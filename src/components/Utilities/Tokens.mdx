# Design Tokens

## What are Design Tokens?

Design tokens are the visual design atoms of the design system — specifically, they are named entities that store visual design attributes. They are used to maintain a scalable and consistent design system by providing a single source of truth for the visual design attributes of the system. Design tokens are the building blocks of the design system and are used to create reusable components and styles. All design tokens are sourced directly from the Chemican Design Figma project by the design team.

## How to work with Design Tokens

To leverage their full potential, it is important to **not use any arbitrary color values** but **always using a token variable** instead. You can use the following pages to effectively choose and copy the correct design token for your task. If there is a design token missing for your current use case, please notify the design team and do not use different unfitting token instead.

## Updating Design Tokens from Figma

The design tokens can be extracted from Figma using the [Variable History plugin](). After replacing `/src/tokens/source.css` with the new token values, run `npm run tokens:generate` to create the new `src/styles/variables.css`, which will be picked up automatically by tailwind to create CSS variables and utility classes. Additionally, it will also create the `src/tokens.ts` file, exporting an Object with all avaliable tokens as well as various types and enums.

## Tailwind integration

The Chemican Design System uses a customized [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite) configuration which replaces the default tailwind colors with the tokens defined in the design tokens. This allows us to use the design tokens directly in our components.

### Customized Tailwind configuration

The customization introduces CSS variables for each color token, which you can use for arbitrary styling. However, the color tokens are also available as Tailwind classes, which you should use in your components. The classes are automatically generated by tailwind and are based on the color tokens defined in the design. To better understand this mechanism, please refer to the [tailwind theme variable documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/theme#theme-variable-namespaces).

### Utility classes

#### Examples

The following example demonstrates how to use the color tokens in your components.

```
.bg-interactive-primary-default => background-color: var(--color-interactive-primary-default);
.text-interactive-primary-default => color: var(--color-text-interactive-primary-default);
.border-interactive-light => border-color: var(--color-border-interactive-light);
```
