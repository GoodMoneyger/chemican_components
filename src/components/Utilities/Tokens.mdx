# Design Tokens

## What are Design Tokens?

Design tokens are the visual design atoms of the design system — specifically, they are named entities that store visual design attributes. They are used to maintain a scalable and consistent design system by providing a single source of truth for the visual design attributes of the system. Design tokens are the building blocks of the design system and are used to create reusable components and styles. All design tokens are sourced directly from the Chemican Design Figma project by the design team.

## How to work with Design Tokens

To leverage their full potential, it is important to **not use any arbitrary color values** but **always using a token variable** instead. You can use the following pages to effectively choose and copy the correct design token for your task. If there is a design token missing for your current use case, please notify the design team and do not use different unfitting token instead.

## Updating Design Tokens from Figma

The design tokens can be extracted from Figma using the [Figma Token Exporter](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1345069854741911632/figma-token-exporter). After replacing `/src/tokens/source.css` with the new token values, run `npm run tokens:generate` to create the new `src/styles/variables.css`, which will be picked up automatically by tailwind to create CSS variables and utility classes. Additionally, it will also create the `src/tokens.ts` file, exporting an Object with all avaliable tokens as well as various types and enums.

## Tailwind integration

The Chemican Design System uses a customized [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite) configuration which replaces the default tailwind colors with the tokens defined in the design tokens. This allows us to use the design tokens directly in our components.

### Customized Tailwind configuration

The customization introduces CSS variables for each color token, which you can use for arbitrary styling. However, the color tokens are also available as Tailwind classes, which you should use in your components. The classes are automatically generated by tailwind and are based on the color tokens defined in the design. To better understand this mechanism, please refer to the [tailwind theme variable documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/theme#theme-variable-namespaces).

### Highly recommended: Use tailwaind plugin for your IDE

To get the most out of the design tokens, it is highly recommended to use a Tailwind CSS plugin for your IDE. This will provide you with autocompletion and documentation for the available utility classes, making it easier to find and use the correct design token. All major IDEs (eg. VS Code or NeoVim) have Tailwind v4 integrations available.

### Utility classes

#### Examples

The following example demonstrates how to use the color tokens in your components.

```
.bg-interactive-primary-default => background-color: var(--color-interactive-primary-default);
.text-interactive-primary-default => color: var(--color-text-interactive-primary-default);
.border-interactive-light => border-color: var(--color-border-interactive-light);
```

### Import Token types and definitons in your project

You can also import the token definitions and types in your project to ensure you are using the correct tokens. The tokens are available in the `@chemican/components` package:

```tsx

import { ColorBackgroundTokens } from '@chemican/components/tokens';

ColorBackgroundTokens.InteractivePrimaryDefault; // "--color-background-interactive-primary-default"
```

This can be useful if you want to reference the tokens in your code, for example when using a CSS-in-JS solution or if you need to dynamically set a token value.
