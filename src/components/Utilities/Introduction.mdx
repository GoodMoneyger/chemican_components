# Chemican Design System

The Chemican Design System is a library of Components, Tokens and a Tailwind preset designed to help easily craft Chemican branded products.

The System is built on top of
- Tailwind to increase customizability and flexibility in consuming projects. If you are not familiar with Tailwind, please check the official [Tailwind documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite). To ensure the effectiveness of our design process. All new projects should use Tailwind together with the chemican tailwind preset.
- [Radix Primitives](https://radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/), which are headless UI components that help us ensuring proper accessibility and a comprehensive base-line functionality of components without reinventing the wheel.
