# Chemican Design System Development

## Use Radix Primitives

When building new components, use [Radix Primitives](https://radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/) as a foundation whenever possible. Radix Primitives is a collection of low-level UI components and hooks that provide the foundation for building design systems and component libraries. Refer to their documentation to access low-level API features. The documentations of individual components includes descriptions of whether a Radix component is used as a base component.

## Use Tailwind classes

When styling components, use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) utility classes whenever possible. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes to build custom designs. Refer to their documentation to access utility classes. The documentations of individual components includes descriptions of whether Tailwind CSS classes are used for styling.

## Use Design Tokens

When styling components, use [Design Tokens](?path=/story/design-system-colors--default) whenever possible. Design Tokens are the visual design atoms of the design system — specifically, they are named entities that store visual design attributes. Refer to their documentation to access design tokens. The documentations of individual components includes descriptions of whether design tokens are used for styling.

## Use semantic versioning

The design system uses a release system that will ensure that consuming projects can update to new versions without breaking changes. The design system follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) to ensure that version numbers convey meaning about the underlying code and what has been modified from one version to the next.
