# Installation

## Prerequisites

- Start by making sure your project uses Tailwind v4, use the [official Tailwind documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite) to set it up
- To streamline the development process, it is highly recommended to use `vite` to bundle your frontend project (though not strictly required)

## Installation

Install the design library via npm

```sh
npm install --save @chemican/components@git+ssh://git@github.com:GoodMoneyger/chemican_components.git#release-1.0.0
```
> Note: Since this is a private repository, you will need to be authenticated to run this command. In CI, this means that the right SSH keys need to be available.

> Note: Ensure you are using a fixed release tag `#release-x.x.x`, that you have to keep updated manually. This is to avoid automatically introducing breaking changes.

**Include the Chemican preset in your CSS:**

```css
@import "tailwindcss"

@import "@chemican/components/tailwind-preset.css"
```

This will add the Chemican theme variables to your project and you can use utility classes like `.bg-interactive-primary-default`.

**Include Components in your project:**
```jsx
import { Button } from '@chemican/components';

const MyComp = () => <div><Button>Chemican Button</Button></div>

```
