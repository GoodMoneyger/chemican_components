# Installation

## Prerequisites

- **React v19 or higher** is required
- Start by making sure your project uses **Tailwind v4**, use the [official Tailwind documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite) to set it up
- To streamline the development process, it is highly recommended to use `vite` to bundle your frontend project (though not strictly required)

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save @chemican/components@git+ssh://git@github.com:GoodMoneyger/chemican_components.git#release-0.0.17
```
> Note: Since this is a private repository, you will need to be authenticated to run this command. In CI, this means that the right SSH keys need to be available.

> Note: Ensure you are using a fixed release tag `#release-x.x.x`, that you have to keep updated manually. This is to avoid automatically introducing breaking changes.

### Recommended method: Import source files

Install the design library via npm


**Include the Chemican preset in your CSS:**

```css
@import "tailwindcss"
@import "@chemican/components/tailwind-preset-next.css"
// @import "@chemican/components/tailwind-preset.css" // Use this for non-Next.js projects instead
@source "../node_modules/@chemican/components";
```

This will add the Chemican theme variables to your project and you can use utility classes like `.bg-interactive-primary-default`.

> Note: The `@source` line is a tailwind directive that ensures tailwind classes of the Chemican components are detected by your Tailwind setup.

> Note: The `tailwind-preset-next.css` file is optimized for Next.js projects in that it does not include font-face declarations, as Next.js has built-in support for fonts. If you are not using Next.js, use `tailwind-preset.css` instead.

**Include the font files (Next.js only):**
```tsx
const notoJp = localFont({
  src: [
    {
      path: '../node_modules/@chemican/components/src/assets/fonts/NotoSansJP-Regular.ttf',
      weight: '400',
      style: 'normal',
    },
    {
      path: '../node_modules/@chemican/components/src/assets/fonts/NotoSansJP-Medium.ttf',
      weight: '500',
      style: 'normal',
    },
    {
      path: '../node_modules/@chemican/components/src/assets/fonts/NotoSansJP-Bold.ttf',
      weight: '700',
      style: 'normal',
    },
  ],
});

export default function App({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <main className={notoJp.className}>
      {children}
    </main>
  );
}
```

**Include Components in your project:**
```jsx
import { Button } from '@chemican/components';

const MyComp = () => <div><Button>Chemican Button</Button></div>

```

### Alternative method: Import pre-built CSS

For simple, one-off projects that do not use Tailwind themselves, you can also use the pre-built CSS file.

In this case, you can download the bundled CSS file from the repository (use the release branch) and include it directly in your HTML:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/chemican-components.css">
```

Additionally, you will need to expose the font files in your project under `/fonts/*`, as the pre-built CSS does not include them. You can find the font files in the `assets/fonts` directory of the repository.

This will include all tokens as CSS variables into your project, but you will not be able to use any components or utility classes.
