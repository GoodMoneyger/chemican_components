# Spacing Tokens

This document provides an overview of the spacing tokens used in our design system. The spacing tokens are based on a base unit of 4px, which is derived from the base font size of 16px divided by 4.

## Tailwind and Base Unit

In Tailwind CSS, the base unit of 4px is used to define spacing classes such as `w-20`. For example, `w-20` corresponds to a width of 80px, which is calculated as 20 times the base unit of 4px.

## Named spacings

Based on the design tokens passed to Tailwind, there are the following named spacings `xxxs` - `xxxl` which can be used in all utitlity classes that use spacings. For example padding, margin, sizes, etc:

<Spacing />
