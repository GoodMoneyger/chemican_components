# Chemican Components

## Build with Radix Primitives

Most of the components in this design system are built with [Radix Primitives](https://radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/). Radix Primitives is a collection of low-level UI components and hooks that provide the foundation for building design systems and component libraries. As such you can refer to their documentation as well to access low-level API features. The documentations of individual components includes descriptions of whether a Radix component is used as a base component.
